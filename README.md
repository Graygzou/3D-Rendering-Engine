# 3D-Rendering-Engine
Basic rendering engine written in Java. This project was made during an rendering course, followed at [ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html), a french engineer school.

# About
 We did not write the full engine but we completed it as part of an assignment. We mainly focus on transformation matrices, depth rendering, lighting interpolation and texture manipulation. 

# Getting started
To launch a scene, run the `src\Renderer` class. 
You have to provide a `.scene` file in first argument of the run which correspond to the scene you which to render.

All the availables scenes are in the `\data` folder. Each one of them contains a different `.off` file which correspond to a 3D mesh.
